## 1. Installations

The code runs using Python version 3.7. Necessary libraries are:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

You can install any missing libraries using `pip`:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## 2. Project Motivation

The project aims to analyze Airbnb data for Seattle to answer the following questions:

    How do the rental prices in Seattle change depending on the time of the year?
    How does the availability of Airbnb accommodations change in Seattle throughout the year?
    How are some relevant details about the Airbnb correlated with the price of the rental?

The motivation behind the project is to provide insights to potential Airbnb users in Seattle so they can make more informed decisions regarding their accommodation.

## 3. File Descriptions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (workbook.ipynb), which includes all the exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, visualizations necessary to answer the project's questions.

The raw data files are not included in the repository due to their large size, but can be obtained from Kaggle.
